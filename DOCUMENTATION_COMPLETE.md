5. Copy the token (save safely!)

### Step 2: Add Secret to GitHub

1. Go to GitHub repository Settings
2. Navigate to: **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**
3. Click **"New repository secret"**
4. Create:
   - **Name:** `NPM_TOKEN`
   - **Value:** `npm_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`
5. Click **"Add secret"**

### Step 3: Enable GitHub Actions

1. Go to: **Actions** tab in repository
2. If disabled, enable it:
   - Click **"Enable GitHub Actions"**
   - Or go to **Settings** → **Actions** → **General**
   - Select **"Allow all actions and reusable workflows"**

### Step 4: Verify Configuration

Push a test commit to main:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "test: verify GitHub Actions"
git push origin main
```

Check workflow runs:
- Go to **Actions** tab
- You should see:
  - ✅ **CI** workflow running

## 📝 Automated Publishing Workflow

### For Developers (Future Updates)

```bash
# 1. Make your changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat: new feature"

# 2. Create changeset (auto-bumps version)

# ? Which packages would you like to include?
# ? What type of change? (patch/minor/major)
# ? Please enter a summary of the changes

# 3. Commit changeset
git add .changeset/
git commit -m "chore: version bump"

# 4. Push to main
git push origin main

# GitHub Actions will:
# ✅ Build and test packages
# ✅ Create Release PR
# ✅ (When merged) Publish to npm
# ✅ Create GitHub Release
```

❌ Never share token with anyone
```

### Workflow Security
```
